# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository is my submission for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project. 
The aim of this project was to clean/tidy a data set so that it is ready for further analysis.
The data used was collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Files  
- FinalData.txt: the final data exported after the process of cleaning/tidying the data was carried out
- run_analysis.R: prepares the data and then followed the 5 steps as laid out in the project instructions
- CodeBook.md: describes the variables, data, and any transformations carried out to tidy up the data
